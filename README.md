# fracgen-gui
this is an initial working version, ALL code will be replaced and rewritten at SOME point

`z | x` less/more der bail
`alt`: 
      `<- | ->` adjust colors
      `up | down` adjust bailout
      `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9` fractal modes
`no keybind`:
      `<- | ->` adjust iter count
      `up | down` adjust sample distance in pixel-to-pixel distance
      `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9` coloring modes
`i | o` adjust light angle
`k | l` adjust secondary light angle offset (useful, I swear ;3)
`SPACE` render 8 samples
`j` go into julia mode
`ENTER` render parameters in full res
`SCROLL` zoom
`CLICK + DRAG` pan
hold right click in julia mode to select coord
press middle mouse to peek the normal fractal to help guide where to pick points
